As investors begin to look to what’s in store for the year ahead, our experts help set the stage. Here are some of the highlights from Yahoo Finance's theme weeks. Taxes (00:00:03) As part of the Yahoo Finance's Ultimate Tax Guide weekly series, Dan Geltrude, Geltrude & Company Founder, broke down some of the most important changes in the tax code for 2023. Geltrude said, ""Good news. The standard deductions are larger this year. The Child Tax Credit, a little bit smaller this year. Also, the expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Credit is expiring."" Real Estate (00:00:27) Shark Tank star and The Corcoran Group Founder Barbara Corcoran thinks that now is the absolute best time to buy a home. As part of Yahoo Finance's weekly series Real Estate: The New Reality, Corcoran said, ""I think it's the absolute best time to buy a home. There's nothing in my logic that says it makes sense to wait. You ought to jump in now and get the house while you can."" Retirement (00:00:39) Opportunity Knock$ Financial Coach Jean Chatzky believes that it is best to weigh one's income streams against their biggest expenses, including where you live, far ahead of retirement. As part of Yahoo Finance's weekly series Retirement Readiness: Planning Your Future, Chatzky said, ""The first thing that you have to do is figure out what your retirement looks like ... When are you retiring? Where are you retiring? What will you do day-to-day in your retirement?"" Retail (00:01:05) As part of Yahoo Finance's week-long series Retail Evolution: The New Era, Tanger Outlets (SKT) CEO Stephen Yalof discussed the uptick in outlet mall shopping and the new-found approachability of luxury brands. Yalof said, ""Outlet centers are value shopping experiences for people that are looking to buy brands at the best possible price.

EVs (00:01:31) As part of Yahoo Finance's weekly series EVs: The Road Ahead, Blink Charging (BLNK) President and CEO Brendan Jones and Plug In America Executive Director Joel Levin discussed the most important challenges behind the EV charging infrastructure. Jones believes that consumers need to break the trend of fueling at a station rather than using reliable home chargers. He explained, ""We have to break the dominant paradigm of charging by saying, you don't have to go to a depot or fuel station. You can charge at work. You can charge at home."" Healthcare (00:01:41) Amazon (AMZN) has made a big push into the healthcare industry. Amazon Pharmacy Chief Medical Officer Dr. Vin Gupta joins Yahoo Finance as part of the weekly series Healthcare: Industry Checkup to describe how Amazon Pharmacy delivers prescriptions directly to customers' doors.

Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley takes a look at the year AI has had as part of Yahoo Finance's Countdown: Top Stories of 2023. “To say that 2023 was the year of AI, would be the understatement of, well, the year,” Howley said. ""It started in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. The chatbot quickly became the fastest growing app in history, to that point,” hitting 100 million users in two months. In May 2023, Nvidia’s (NVDA) market value “briefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time, cementing its status as the AI chip leader.” Investor Guide (00:02:40) The Magnificent Seven didn't just dominate the markets this year, they also topped the list of the most trafficked ticker pages on Yahoo Finance. Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT) topped the ranking. Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre broke down the list as part of the weekly series 2024 Investor Guide. ""Not surprisingly in a year that was all about the mega caps, the Mag Seven, they dominate the top ten most popular pages visited by you on the Yahoo Finance app and website,"" Blikre said. ""And the winner by far is Tesla ... that was seen over 300 million times this year."""
