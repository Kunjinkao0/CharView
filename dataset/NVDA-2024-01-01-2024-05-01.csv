Synovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Dan Morgan and Creative Strategies CEO and Principal Strategist Ben Bajarin joined Market Domination to discuss the potential impact of artificial intelligence on Big Tech earnings. Bajarin highlights two main concerns: ""Who's getting the most beneficiary lift from AI stocks?"" and ""Do we have outsized expectations of AI growth?"" However, he believes tech earnings will see strong growth due to AI infrastructure investments. Bajarin expresses worry about potential volatility stemming from ""the bubble-ish cycle of AI."" He also notes that costs associated with AI innovation could be a factor affecting earnings. Morgan emphasizes that if investors look beyond the AI hype, Big Tech is ""looking at very strong growth"" across the core business models. While companies like AMD (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) do have substantial profit growth fueled by AI, Morgan notes that for earnings from names like Microsoft and Meta there won't be ""a huge AI effect, in terms of like 30% growth coming from AI, but their core businesses are very strong."" He adds that if the Federal Reserve were to refrain from cutting rates and inflation remains elevated, these tech giants ""are delivering growth regardless of what the Fed is doing.""

With more and more companies getting involved in AI, it can be hard for any investor to wade through the names and find a great entry point for their portfolio. Morgan Stanley Equity Analyst Stephen Byrd joins Yahoo Finance to break down some of the best AI picks that have gone under the radar for many on Wall Street and what investors need to keep in mind with the AI sector. Byrd points out one of the biggest drives behind his picks and why they have much room to grow: ""We see about a 50% drop in... essentially the cost of compute, cost of computation, in these data centers. That's really all Nvidia (NVDA). It's these new chips that are just much more efficient. And that's flowing through the entire ecosystem. As those costs drop, we think demand for a variety of gen. AI applications will rise, and that's essentially the thesis of our view of gen. AI adoption across many industries.""

Kestra Investment Management CIO Kara Murphy and Spear Invest Founder and CIO Ivana Delevska join Market Domination to help investors navigate the bigger picture amid uncertain economic conditions. Murphy points out the strength in the market despite Fed expectations: ""Economic growth has been stronger, corporate earnings have been stronger. What we're finding is that there's some really good fundamental underpinning for the strength in equities, so yes, it might be a bit of a disappointment that we don't get the Fed rate cuts, but the fact is the economy just doesn't need it."" Delevska claims the market can reach new heights thanks to a shift to earnings: ""We cover the technology sectors specifically, so we didn't like some of the more cyclical areas like semiconductors, you will see explosive growth, because earnings have really been under pressure, anywhere you look outside of AI. Then on the softer side, you're not going to see as being earning surprises, but those companies have really struggled to keep up their high-growth numbers. I think that is going to really change as we get into the second half."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

D.A. Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why he believes that Nvidia's continued market domination is ""very unlikely.""  Luria says 2024 will be ""a spectacular year for Nvidia."" With Nvidia's top customers having openly stated plans to purchase more of the company's products, Luria says, ""There's a lot of comfort in knowing that Nvidia can exceed its expectations."" However, he warns that market and technology trends could threaten this momentum, suggesting that Nvidia's current dominance ""won't last for very long."" Luria projects that by 2026, Nvidia could face ""a normal cyclical downturn."" He explains that despite the company's massive market share, its customers have even larger footprints in the landscape. If these customers continue investing in Nvidia's chips at the current pace, the companies themselves could lose market share in the long run, casting doubt on the sustainability of Nvidia's revenue margins.

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward. O'Donnell talks about potential leaders in tech for the long-term: ""The one thing is, Nvidia's got 90% share. Anybody who's got 90% share is going to lose a little share. But, that doesn't mean they still can't grow organically from where they are. You're just going to see a lot more competitors.

Here's why.,"Nvidia (NVDA) partner SK Hynix (000660.KS) plans to invest nearly $4 billion to build an advanced chip-packaging facility in West Lafayette, Indiana, according to a WSJ report. The investment is a boon to President Biden's goal to bring more extensive chip production to the US. TD Cowen Managing Director Matthew Ramsay joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what the investment means for the semiconductor sector. Ramsay explains many of the top chip companies driving the AI and PC market manufacture most of their products in Taiwan. However, SK Hynix's efforts to create an Indiana plant can be seen as a long-term plan to build out manufacturing and other layers of the supply chain in the US and Europe –– changes Ramsay says are ""super important for the industry."" ""Everyone's in this boat together,"" Ramsay says of chip makers' Taiwan concentration. However, Ramsay notes Intel is also pushing to diversify its manufacturing away from a single hub, having manufactured stateside ""for decades."" Ramsay adds that Micron could benefit from CHIPS Act funding, a ""necessary step for them to regain competitiveness with Nvidia"" and other tech names.

Micron is being very disciplined there and importantly the same goes for Hynix (000660.KS) and Samsung (005930.KS), the other two major players in memory, so as long as this dynamic persists of the industry being very disciplined when it comes to adding supply and demand steadily recovering, the setup is very strong for the remainder of 2024.""

126519413,2024-03-15 22:14:41,n/a,Nvidia GTC AI conference: What to watch,"To say Nvidia (NVDA) is on a hot streak is an understatement. Shares of the AI darling are up a staggering 232 percent over the past 12 months, and 84 percent year-to-date. Tech companies across the world covet its graphics cards like rare jewels, and CEO Jensen Huang is as in demand as some heads of state. On Monday March 18, Huang will kick off Nvidia’s annual GTC conference with a two-hour keynote at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, outlining what’s ahead for the company through 2024. In prior years, Nvidia has used the show to announce some of its biggest products. And this year, Nvidia is widely expected to debut its latest graphics architecture and graphics processing chip, kicking off what could be a new rush on the company’s products. The new architecture, codenamed Blackwell, and GPU, dubbed the B100, are expected to offer far better performance when it comes to running AI models like OpenAI’s GPT-3 than the company’s current top of the line H100 and h200 cards. Nvidia isn’t exactly hiding its plans for the B100. During the Supercomputer 2023 conference, the company showed off a slide outlining the GPU’s potential performance. In addition to the Blackwell architecture and B100 card, Nvidia will likely give attendees and viewers a look at the latest advancements to its CUDA software. The platform, which lets programmers take advantage of a GPU’s processing capabilities for AI and other applications, is an essential part of Nvidia’s overall enterprise strategy and helps lock in developers who build on Nvidia’s software, virtually ensuring they’ll stick with Nvidia’s products in the future. Nvidia could also announce that it will begin producing its H20 AI chip for the Chinese market. The chip, according to Reuters, is meant to serve as an alternative to Nvidia’s more powerful H100 and H200 chips, which Nvidia is prohibited from shipping to china for fear that the country’s government will use them to produce AI applications for its military. Those are the big stories we’ll be watching from GTC, but you can likely expect plenty of other announcements and debuts from both Nvidia and its partners. Yahoo Finance will be on the ground bringing you all of the biggest news from the conference and chatting with some of Nvidia’s top executives. Stay tuned."

Miller Tabak Managing Director and Equity Strategist Matt Maley joins Yahoo Finance to discuss indicators for a possible market pullback and Nvidia's performance. Maley notes that certain stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) are the most overbought they have been in years, signaling an incoming pullback: ""I think we'll see a full correction, a pullback about 10%, much like we did last year. It was the same type of thing. Interest rates last summer were moving higher, moving higher, the market completely ignored it, until it didn't. Finally by August they started paying attention and sure enough, the market saw a 10% correction, even though obviously it's gotten higher since then. I think we are seeing the same thing now, the markets ignoring those higher interest rates recently, but I think...now that they're starting to tick back up again after yesterday's inflation report, they're going to have to pay attention to it more.""

However, there are other value-based tech picks that investors may be overlooking. The Futurum Group Chief Market Strategist Cory Johnson and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Doug Clinton join Yahoo Finance to discuss hidden gem stocks within tech. Johnson explains that investors may need to reframe their investments in tech beyond growth: ""We've seen tech as growth and indeed a lot of tech companies without profits are hard to value as value stocks, but I think a lot of that has changed over time and we've seen the king of all value investors Warren Buffett with his giant holdings in Apple (AAPL) and in this notion that technology can't be valued is just wrong, and then there's timing and that's when investors have to think about what they're investing for and what kinds of returns and when they need them and to understand if it's worth a long wait."" Clinton emphasizes that it may be important to look downstream of tech giants. SK Hynix (000660.KS), he points out, is a provider of tech to Nvidia: ""Nvidia uses the Hynix's high bandwidth memory in their chips that are in huge demand right now from hyper-scalers and now potentially sovereign nations and other industrial companies that are building their AI infrastructure, so we see Hynix which a holding in our Deepwater Frontier Tech index, that powers the Loup ETF (LOUP) –– we see Hynix as a potential beneficiary of continued demand for those Nvidia chips.

126412132,2024-03-09 05:50:47,n/a,Chipmakers reach new highs: How investors should capitalize,"AI-based tech stocks have seen an unprecedented rally in US markets, with Nvidia (NVDA) leading the charge. While some fear that what goes up must come down, other investors believe these stocks still have room to grow. Mizuho Americas Desk Based Analyst Jordan Klein and KeyBanc Capital Markets Equity Research Analyst John Vinh join Yahoo Finance to discuss how far the momentum can go and which names are best positioned to outperform the broader trend. Vinh explains that while companies such as Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Broadcom (AVGO) recorded increases from AI-related businesses, the gains did not compensate for worse-than-expected performance in other domains: ""Both Marvell and Broadcom reported overnight... their AI businesses grew well over 100% for each of those companies but obviously in the near term we are going through kind of a broader inventory correction, particularly on enterprise, seeing some de-stocking activity there. So obviously in the near term it's obviously not enough to offset some of those sort of headwinds, but I think longer term I think if you are an AI bull we certainly still have conviction in the longer term stories related to these AI names. As investor sentiment on semiconductors begins to resemble a frenzy, Klein relays some of his uneasiness regarding the momentous tech rally: ""I'm uneasy just because of the way the stocks are trading. I'm not uneasy at all about the fundamentals, what some of these companies are saying and doing particularly Nvidia and AMD (AMD) and Broadcom and Marvell or the memory companies or semi-cap equipment. I think there is a real long runway for further growth and upside, but I'm always fearful when you get this fear of missing out kind of chase mentality amongst investors.""

But are there opportunities in the sector for other companies to make an intervention? Constellation Research founder and analyst R ""Ray"" Wang and TD Cowen managing director and senior equity research analyst John Blackledge join the Live show to discuss the future of the Magnificent Seven tech stocks and what investors need to keep in mind with so many possibilities in the sector. While Apple (AAPL) has made forays into generative AI, investors say they want more. Wang, however, sees existing potential, such as the expansion of Apple Ferret, an open-source machine learning model, and Apple chips with built-in AI. He signals that the recent regulations levied against Apple rom the Europe Union might affect AI stocks moving forward: ""The challenge with AI and regulatory bodies is this is the opportunity for an aspiring politician to save the world and help us with privacy and stop big tech. And without understanding the cost/benefit analysis of what they're going up against. So you are going to see a lot more regulatory pressure and headwinds that are going to affect a lot of these tech companies, especially as government wants to get involved in the regulatory aspect of AI because tech is one of the few industries that is so lightly regulated compared to everything else."" Blackledge elaborates on the nature of competition between tech companies in their pursuit of generative AI: ""Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI clearly won the headline battle last year for sure. Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), as far as I was tracking, right, probably in February, March, start to go faster with it. They had some good announcements in IO last year, last May. Obviously we're talking about the Gemini launch and it is going to be a little bit uneven but I do believe it's there for them to do well and to benefit like I was saying earlier with their cloud business, for enterprises and small business, and then with their Gemini suite of products for consumers. I agree, we've heard from all of our companies have reported. They're all using generative AI across their companies for internal functions and what not. We think Alphabet will be there for it. The pressure is definitely on."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

However, as more investment is poured into AI, some fear the potential for a bubble to form. Citi Head of US Semiconductor Research Chris Danely joins Yahoo Finance to share his perspective about the AI sector's continued room for growth, despite the fact that AI hardware like semiconductors historically experiences cyclical growth. Danely is particularly bullish on semiconductors, sharing his top pick within the sector: ""We've all identified Nvidia as the clear AI leader. I guess in this sort of instantaneous market, they're almost yesterday's news in terms of AI. What we think is going to be the next group of semiconductors or product of semiconductors that's going to have the AI mentioning is going to be memory and specifically DRAM. So, clearly, there's a lot of graphics chips going into it, clearly there's a lot of ethernet chips that Broadcom (AVGO) makes...We think that's the next positive catalyst for the AI market, but you're just starting to see memory come into play as, wow, we need more of this, this is in shortage, and Micron (MU) is the top pick on the DRAM space for us.

He warns of ""concentration risks,"" noting that in the Technology Select Spdr Fund (XLK) just 5 names account for more than 50% of the fund. Nadig advises those investing in tech to ""look for strategies that are a little bit more equal-weighted."" He suggests something like the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO) which is ""much more balanced"" with global diversification across use cases. Many tech ETFs have ""hyper-concentrated"" portfolios, with stocks like Microsoft (MSFT), for example, dominating the top holdings. On the days that dominate stock does well, ""performance will beat everybody else,"" while down days see similar exaggerated moves. Nadig recommends focusing on long-term plays that ""benefit over the cycle, not just over the headline.""

125908630,2024-02-16 03:49:13,n/a,Beyond the Ticker: Nvidia,"From creating chips for gaming to becoming one of the world's leading AI chip companies, it's safe to say Nvidia (NVDA) is officially one of the tech giants. In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

When asked about the gap between China and America chips, and what they have to do to catch up, Ragson explains that there is a big gap and ""What does that mean? That means you have to shovel more chips at the problem. For example the Huawei Ascend supposedly is roughly equivalent to a Nvidia A100, and that part from Nvidia is two or three years old...If they want to get the same amount of performance as Nvidia's or others are delivering with their current parts, they'll have to put a lot more silicon in place in order to do that, so that costs money in terms of chip cost, it cost a lot of money in terms of power and infrastructure and everything else, and so is it going to be cost competitive? Like if they had to sell that stuff elsewhere? Absolutely not, it's not competitive, but they have no choice, so they'll do it.""

Things like PCs and smartphones, which actually went through their bathtubs, they were very weak last year, they're coming out the other side of it though. Those should probably grow this year, some. I'd say things like more in the meat of the downturn, the traditional data center, data center service CPUs, networking, that sort of thing are pretty weak.

125332645,2024-01-27 04:17:12,n/a,"Best of AI week: Nvidia, regulation, election risk, and more","AI is now a part of our lives: regulators are looking to keep tabs on the biggest players, the tech titans are now looking to make money from it, and we’re all still wondering – is it the end of civilization as we know it? Who’s going to get there first on meaningful regulation? Who are the biggest AI players you haven’t thought of yet? Will legal battles squash innovation, or open it up? Yahoo Finance caught up with experts across the industry to answer these questions and more as part of its weekly series The AI Revolution. Here are some of the best moments. Where are we now? (00:00:05) Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley discussed Nvidia's (NVDA) AI advancements, competitors Intel (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and where the AI race will go moving forward. ""Nvidia is the AI king. They eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap in June,"" Howley said. ""The big ones (rivals) really are AMD, which has been a long-time thorn in their side, and Intel."" Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor discussed the outlook for generative AI adoption and corporate valuations. Windsor explained, ""There is a big use case for artificial intelligence, yes. It's just not worth the valuations that people are ascribing to them because they think the prices are going to be much higher than they really are."" Finding a referee (00:00:46) Yahoo Finance Legal Reporter Alexis Keenan broke down global AI regulation policies—comparing how different countries are setting up different rules for AI. Keenan said, ""The deep fakes, these are one of the major risks that IP lawyers, tech lawyers talk about ... Also, AI that impacts government infrastructure, that's another big area of concern."" U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Ca.) is a part of the bipartisan effort introducing the Federal Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Act to Congress, which aims to provide AI regulatory guidelines. Rep. Lieu explained, ""What this bill does is it mandates that the standards set forth by the (National) Institute of Standards and Technology be applied to both the Federal government as well as any companies that want to contract with the Federal government."" Tom Davenport, Babson College President’s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management, discussed the adoption of AI and AI regulation across the globe. Davenport said, ""A lot of potential opportunity. The biggest barrier now is in the data and how organizations get their data ready for generative AI."" Monetizing AI (00:01:37) AI Now Institute Co-Founder and Chief Advisor Meredith Whittaker broke down the recent tech sector layoffs and restructurings that have been fueled by AI. Whittaker said, ""I think what we need is to see increased union density, so workers have more leverage over deciding where AI is introduced and how it's used."" Boosted.ai Co-Founder and CEO Joshua Pantony highlighted the benefits of using generative AI models for investing, and how it is different from past generations of investing programs. Pantony explained, ""If you use a system like ours, you're going to be able to learn information a lot faster. And the other side is really around efficiency of your process."" Legal woes (00:02:14) Ryan Abbott, Brown Neri Smith & Khan, LLP Partner, broke down legal precedents surrounding AI including patent and copyright infringement laws. ""What we're fundamentally seeing is this new sort of activity where you have machines that are behaving like people, and legal systems that were designed with human centric concepts,"" Abbott said. ""A company like Novo Nordisk (NVO) uses AI to develop Wegovy or Ozempic, can they patent something like that, or do you need a traditional human inventor?"" Accenture (ACN) Chief Technology Officer Paul Daugherty discussed AI data and the ways workplace AI may effectively be incorporated into many business models to benefit workers. Daugherty explained, ""There hasn't been anything like generative AI ... it is different. The reason is one, the speed ... the second is this human-like nature of the technology. And as a result of that, it changes everything that people do."" Election risk (00:02:59) Yahoo Finance Senior Columnist Rick Newman broke down how AI will impact the U.S. Presidential election in 2024 and what Americans need to be on the lookout for. Newman said, ""Disinformation in elections is not new ... so I think what's going to be new in 2024 is just the sophistication of the bogus information. It's a lot easier to use AI to do fake videos that look like real people, fake audio recordings."" Generative AI speaker and advisor Nina Schick discussed the political ramifications to come from the AI boom. Schick explained, ""When people start to understand that anything can be synthetic, anything can be AI generated, anything can be faked, they begin to lose trust in everything. And I think that is one of the core challenges we're facing.""

125259488,2024-01-24 01:21:29,n/a,Why upcoming tech earnings may be 'parabolic' for the market,"Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) saw their stock prices jump thanks to their big push to invest and make advancements in AI. Thanks to that outsized growth, there is a potential that they will continue to maintain their dominance on the S&P 500 (^GSPC). As they hold their dominance, the outcome of their earnings can have major sway over the broader market. Ken Mahoney, CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss upcoming earnings from major tech companies and how they could have a sizable impact on the broader market that investors would not want to miss out on. When it comes to expectations for the outcome of potential tech earnings, Mahoney affirms : ""There could be a little sell on the news reaction, but I think the guidance is going to be key. The law of big numbers is incredible, I mean Nvidia as an example, last 12 months has doubled topline revenue, expected to double topline revenue in '24 and '25 and the CEO of Nvidia said 'Hey, we're in the second, third inning.' I hear this all the time. 'Ken, I missed it, I missed it.' Well, the CEO, who is really at the epicenter of all this, is telling you that we're probably in the second or third inning. You might not want to stay around until the ninth or extra innings, but there's a pretty long runway to make some money akin to what we saw in the mid 1990s.

However, mixed economic reports out of China disappointed many on Wall Street. It calls into question what investors need to consider when investing in China-exposed companies. James Early, BBAE Chief Investment Officer, and Dory Wiley, Commerce Street Capital President, joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Chinese markets and what investors should keep their eyes on. Early affirms: ""I don't think the Chinese economy is a big driver for semis [semiconductors]. The driver there is probably regulation, but going back to the Chinese economy, I would liken it to the adult child who's trying to move out of his parent's basement, but is just having trouble doing that... By that I mean, they've kind of been trying to get on its own feet in a consumer spending sense, it's about 53% of the economy right now, where as the US is about 68%, but they're just struggling.""Wiley responds: ""I don't like the exposure to China, I don't like it right now. China is almost uninvestable. That's hard to hear from an investing point of view because we try to keep politics out of it, but there's so many fundamental reasons to try to avoid China as much as we can... China is--exports are down, population is down, the markets down 30%... real estate debt issues, government debt issues, no new construction, and their politics has gone from a party dictatorship to a person dictatorship. So they're moving the wrong direction."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Piper Sandler has pointed out in a note that Nvidia's GPU building capacity foreshadows a growth for application software-based stocks as generational AI and data processing capabilities pick up. Piper Sandler Senior Research Analyst Brent Bracelin joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into the note and why stocks like Workday (WDAY) , Monday.com (MNDY), and Klaviyo (KVYO) are some top ideas to own in 2024. Bracelin explains why there's a great investment opportunity with these stocks: ""There were over 40 cloud software companies growing over 30% back in 2021. If you fast forward to next year there's only four. So growth is scarce again. We think we're entering a whole new investment cycle for these cloud application companies. This time it's really driven by the need to move these applications, these old applications where your data is locked up in on-prem software, you have to modernize to unlock the data and open up some new AI opportunities. So we're at the beginning of what we think is a big generational investment cycle."" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.
