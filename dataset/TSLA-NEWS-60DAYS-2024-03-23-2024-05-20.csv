The push to autonomous, the push to robotaxi — these could be potentially largely disruptive bets, but they're binary. People just don't know what the outcome is.""

How can the auto sector ignite demand and what is ahead for the space in the near and long term? The Futurum Group Research Director Olivier Blanchard joins Market Domination to discuss the shift in focus for automakers to make EVs and hybrids. Blanchard lays out one of the current issues with the EV market, causing slower adoption among consumers: ""Currently the EV market and the automotive market for software-defined vehicles and EVs, simultaneously, is a little skewed on the side of more expensive models, and consumers are just kind of worried about that kind of spending right now. Things are expensive. Obviously, there's inflation. There's a little bit of price gouging and people are a little bit closer to their budgets and so what we're seeing is a reluctance to buy EVs for two reasons. One, most are still a little above the price point that the average consumer for a mainstream adoption of EVs is comfortable with and the other one is fear about charging and infrastructure, about the serviceability of the vehicles, and also about the long-term resale of these vehicles once the batteries and the technologies on board have a few years on them.""

Deutsche Bank Lead US Autos Analyst Emmanuel Rosner joins Market Domination to explain the downgrade. Rosner says ""there's a strategic change"" occurring within Tesla, saying that the company's new pricing strategies could potentially boost margins and overall profitability. However, he cautions that if Tesla redirects all of its resources toward the development of a robotaxi, it could face prolonged challenges. For long-term investors, the concept of the robotaxi remains ""exciting"", but Rosner expresses concerns about Tesla's new direction. He emphasizes the risks of concentrating the company’s efforts solely on the robotaxi, moving away from its core electric vehicle production. According to Rosner, this strategy ""is extremely risky for investors"", as ""it's betting the entire company on robotaxi"", an unproven market segment that other automotive competitors have faced setbacks in.

I want to make it clear, the products are amazing. It's a great company with great employees and I just think it's being mismanaged at this point.

To provide insight into these developments, Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware Charles Elson Founding Director joins Market Domination. Elson expresses skepticism about the potential approval of Musk's compensation plan, noting that even if shareholders were to vote in favor, it may not supersede the previous court decision that struck down the package. He emphasizes that the plan being proposed is not meaningfully different from the one that was deemed ""not effectively fair"" by the courts. On the proposed move, ""The real question is, why would a shareholder vote for a move that the CEO says a court has decided against me because what I did was inequitable? So, I'm going to a jurisdiction where they'll say that's okay,"" Elson told Yahoo Finance. Elson argues that, ultimately, the board's responsibility is to ensure that Tesla survives beyond Musk's tenure. ""At some point you have to say 'enough.' That's that where I think you need board refreshment. Obviously this board is unwilling to do it,"" Elson says.

Doran finds Ford to be performing in line when compared to General Motors' (GM) proportionally larger figures, giving the former more room to grow, especially as it prioritizes new hybrid models while EV charging infrastructure is slowly built out. ""There's a number of catalysts because this has been an ongoing turnaround story, and they have done so many things,"" Doran tells Yahoo Finance. ""One of them... is just rationalizing their product lineup. They're really looking for which vehicles are the most profitable and for them that tends to be their pickup trucks, their SUVs, they've really scaled down on the cars..."" Tesla's biggest challenge, according to Doran, is that it's beginning to lose market share to domestic and Chinese competitors. ""The total pie has expanded, but the pie is not expanding for now. So they're losing share both in China and in the US, and you've seen this through their price cuts."" Catch more of Good Buy or Goodbye here, or watch this full episode of Market Domination.

127010401,2024-04-15 17:55:09,neutral,Electric air taxis are nearing launch. Here’s how to invest.,"You could be flying above traffic to the airport in an electric air taxi for the same cost as an Uber (UBER) by 2025, at least according to Joby Aviation (JOBY). Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing vehicles (eVTOLs) promise efficient, battery-powered transport akin to urban Ubers or Lyfts (LYFT) in the sky. With backing from major players like Delta (DAL) and Toyota (TM), Joby thinks they can be first to market in the crowded space. However, regulatory approval remains a key hurdle. The Federal Aviation Administration thinks a competitive, scaled air taxi market could launch in at least one location by 2028. Yahoo Finance spoke with industry investors, officials, and analysts, and traveled to Joby’s manufacturing facility in Marina, CA, to get a closer look at what to expect from this emerging sector. For those looking to play the future of aviation, regulatory hurdles, lack of infrastructure, and customer affordability are among the top considerations when sussing out eVTOL investments. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.

Citi is the latest group to lower its price target, setting the figure at $180 per share from $196. The analyst behind the call, Citi Autos & Auto Parts Analyst Itay Michaeli, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the challenges ahead for Tesla.  Michaeli explains that the reduced price target reflects Tesla's first quarter delivery miss and other April data points. He explains that Tesla's challenges are the outcome of its own success over the years, having created a saturated effect on vehicle sales in certain regions, such as the US. ""When you do have these levels of saturation, even price cuts don't do much to stimulate demand,"" Michaeli says. While these challenges are ""solvable,"" the Citi analyst adds that the issues are having a bigger effect than expected on the automaker. On Tesla's robotaxi unveiling, Michaeli notes his appreciation for the company's focus on autonomous vehicles, calling autonomous driving the ""most powerful mobility mega-trend out there."" However, he outlines a scenario in which Tesla does not sufficiently discuss deployment challenges during the robotaxi's unveiling.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance.

126726560,2024-03-28 17:55:16,neutral,GM's Mary Barra is going all in on EVs,"Contrary to other automakers, who in response to slowing consumer demand are scaling back plans to convert their car and truck lineups to all-electric, General Motors (GM) Chair & CEO Mary Barra is still all in on EVs. ""We will be selling more EVs in this country than anyone else, including Tesla,"" Barra told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in an exclusive interview at GM's technical campus in Michigan.It's a fitting stance for a leader who has overcome a host of issues over her 10 years at the helm of 100-year-old plus GM - by taking a different approach and applying a different vision than others before her. At the time Barra took over as CEO, General Motors was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely changing GM's siloed culture and simultaneously changing how the public viewed the company’s cars, as well as regaining their trust. And now she's looking to take GM into a future that she believes includes cars and trucks that run on batteries. Yahoo Finance got the rare opportunity to sit shotgun with Barra in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette to hear how the change-maker CEO intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles, despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders. Lead This Way is an interview series that features frank conversations with today’s leaders. The series gives consumers and investors an inside look into the innovative thinking and diverse life experiences of some of the biggest players in business to find out how they lead through change, and how they define success for themselves and their organizations.
