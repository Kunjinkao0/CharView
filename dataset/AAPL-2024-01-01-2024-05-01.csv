Higgins names Apple shares as his good buy, stating that the tech leader may be on the up-and-up after the stock slid in 2024's first quarter. Higgins points to Apple's quick adoption and integration of AI into its devices as a major catalyst. ""They have been gobbling up AI companies below the radar — I think they've bought 32 of them,"" Higgins says. ""Clearly they're working on it because If they don't they're facing an existential threat to their very survival. I think Apple has been keeping its head down while its stock has faltered."" Arm is the stock Higgins would wish to say good buy to, calling the semiconductor designer overvalued as early investors were ""looking for different ways to chase Nvidia (NVDA)"" in the broad chip landscape.

126843670,2024-04-05 01:44:20,n/a,Amazon history: Beyond the Ticker,"From its start as an online bookstore to its rise in e-commerce and cloud computing, Amazon (AMZN) has become one of the world's most iconic brands. In 2023, the tech juggernaut generated over $575 billion in revenue, boasting more than 200 million Amazon Prime members worldwide. Beyond the Ticker takes a deep dive into some of the company's biggest moments. 1994 Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos from his garage in Bellevue, Washington. It was originally an online bookstore designed to compete with Barnes & Noble (BNED). 1997 On May 15, 1997, Amazon went public via IPO at $18 per share, giving it a valuation of $300 million. 1998 Amazon began selling CDs, marking the start of its effort to become a shopping Goliath. 2005 The company launched Amazon Prime, a $79 per year membership with free two-day shipping on eligible orders. 2006 Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform would go on to become the top cloud computing platform, ahead of rivals Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and one of Amazon’s most successful businesses. 2011 The company rebranded its video service as Amazon Instant Video with access to 5,000 movies and TV shows for Prime members. 2014 Amazon acquired the video game streaming website Twitch for $970 million. 2017 Amazon acquired high-end supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017 for $13.7 billion. It has since integrated the two companies, offering discounts to Prime members. 2018 On September 4, 2018, Amazon became just the second US company ever to reach a $1 trillion market cap, after Apple (AAPL) reached it earlier in the year. 2020 Amazon's sales and profits surged during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, as consumers turned to online shopping. Its total sales increased 38% year-over-year to $386.1 billion, and net income increased 83% to $21.3 billion. 2021 Founder Jeff Bezos announced that he would step down from his role as CEO and be succeeded by AWS CEO Andy Jassy. 2024 Amazon was added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, replacing drugstore giant Walgreens (WBA). The company continues to evolve, investing billions in AI startup Anthropic, developing more smart home products, and launching an AI shopping assistant named Rufus. It’s safe to say Amazon is a staple of the digital age. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

Many of the big names in tech — Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) — have been grouped together and referred to as The Magnificent Seven, but some, like Apple and Tesla, have fallen off from great heights.

I think that's a strong bull signal. The reality is this is a company that's really only been monetizing for just over a year, predominantly with consumers. They've only recently launched offerings to enterprises. It's been publicly reported they're north of a $2 billion revenue run rate.

Sixteen US attorneys general are joining the DOJ suit alleging Apple's practice of creating a monopoly in the smartphone and digital app store markets. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin — who is among the state attorneys general pushing for this case — breaks down the consumer harm Apple's anticompetitive methods have done: ""What we lay out is a pattern that Apple has engaged in of using its market share to restrict and exclude business practices in a way that stifles innovation and makes it harder for consumers to leave the iPhone platform. And as a result of that, it has driven up significantly its own profits and the cost of the products to consumers, so that now in 2024, people are paying over $1,500 for an iPhone, that if you adjust the 2007 price of an iPhone for inflation, it would only be $450.""

Evercore ISI Analyst Amit Daryanani — who has an Outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $220 per share — joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how Apple could potentially recover and get unstuck from the rock-and a-hard place the iPhone maker finds itself in the middle of. Daryanani notes that the EU probe poses ""more headline risk than fundamental risk,"" stating that he doesn't believe it has ""a material impact"" on Apple. However, he suggests that how ""elements in the US play out"" will have a more substantial financial impact on Apple, as investors await the fallout from the DOJ investigation and the broader implications of Apple's AI partnership with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Regarding Apple's stock underperformance, Daryanani attributes it to the fact that the company is not being perceived as ""an AI story."" He anticipates that at its upcoming WWDC 2024 conference, Apple will likely discuss the inclusion of Google's Gemini AI on iPhones and how AI can enhance the iPhone experience, which could serve as a good ""value [proposition]"" for the company's stock.

According to Szabo, the monopoly accusations ""just doesn't make sense."" He points out that when Americans buy a smartphone, they have ""two clear choices"": Apple and Android devices, disbarring any assumptions of a monopoly. He notes as this legal battle continues, Apple's innovation efforts may be impacted ""out of fear"" of being accused of monopolistic practices. Szabo notes that as long as Apple can provide evidence that supports ""business purposes for what they are doing,"" the courts will most likely rule in their favor. He suggests that many of the concerns raised by the DOJ can be ""easily dismissed"" due to the legitimate purposes they serve in relation to Apple products like security prevention and payment processing.

I mean, obviously to your point, which is correct, there's been the criticism that the iPhone was just not as big of a year-over-year upgrade enough to really move a cycle.

As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins."

125908630,2024-02-16 03:49:13,n/a,Beyond the Ticker: Nvidia,"From creating chips for gaming to becoming one of the world's leading AI chip companies, it's safe to say Nvidia (NVDA) is officially one of the tech giants. In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today. Check out more of our Beyond the Ticker series, and be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance. Editor's note: This video was produced by Zach Faulds."

It came a day after the tech giant reported first quarter results that underwhelmed investors.  D.A. Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria says the Vision Pro ""changes perceptions about Apple's ability to innovate,"" an issue that has arisen given the company hasn't launched a new product category for a few years. Luria thinks the device ""will change how we do computing"" and that ""it's Apple taking us way out into the future."" Luria also explains that future devices will likely resemble glasses more than the large headsets consumers are contending with today. In the earnings report, one sore spot for investors was Apple's China sales. On that point, Luria says there is ""very little visibility"" into China sales, describing the outlook as ""murky."" Luria argues there are a lot of factors that figure into Apple's business in China including the country's weakening economy, the competitive handset market, and a government that can be protectionist.  Watch the video above to hear what Luria has to say about advancements with the iPhone and how Apple may use generative AI.

Constellation Research Founder and Principal Analyst R ""Ray"" Wang joins Yahoo Finance to give insight into Apple's AI strategy and share some of the latest tech innovations seen at CES. ""What we've seen over the last couple of quarters is declining revenues but profits are still increasing. That's because the services equation of the rational is actually growing in services a lot more profitable than putting out a piece of hardware,"" Wang says about Apple. ""I would say that we've probably seen those same kind of trends. But we do supplier checks, and suppliers aren't that nervous, in the sense that they're saying... we're going to see a decrease, mostly because we are in a super cycle.""

Behind The Ticker charts its path from humble beginnings to its transformation into a tech giant. 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded Apple in Los Altos, California. The company's first product, the Apple I, was invented by Wozniak and sold later that year. 1984 Apple launched the Macintosh, announced by a $1.5 million television commercial during Super Bowl XVIII. It was the first mass-market personal computer to feature an integral graphic user interface and mouse. 1985 Steve Jobs left Apple and founded the NeXT computer company. 1991 Apple introduced the Power Macintosh line, utilizing PowerPC processors from Motorola and IBM. It is a design that set the standard for most modern laptops. 1996 Steve Jobs returned after leaving the company over a decade earlier. Apple purchased Jobs' NeXT company for its operating system. Jobs was named interim CEO in 1997 and became CEO again in 2000. 1998 The iMac was introduced, selling almost 800,000 units in its first five months. 2001 Apple announced the opening of a line of Apple retail stores to be located throughout major U.S. markets. The first iPod, storing around 1,000 songs, was introduced later that year. 2007 Apple debuted the iPhone, a revolutionary product that changed the way smartphones look and function. 2011 Steve Jobs suffered from pancreatic cancer. He resigned from his position as CEO just before his death and Tim Cook took over as CEO. 2015 The Apple Watch was launched, the first new product range since the departure of Jobs. 2022 Apple became the world's first publicly traded $3 trillion company. It is currently the largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization. 2023 Apple unveiled the Vision Pro which is a mixed-reality headset. Its 2024 launch will mark the first product debut in a new major category since the Apple Watch. Apple will launch the Vision Pro on February 2, 2024, in the U.S., with pre-orders starting on January 19.
