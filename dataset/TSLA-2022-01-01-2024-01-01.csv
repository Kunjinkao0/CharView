""It started in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI. The chatbot quickly became the fastest growing app in history, to that point,” hitting 100 million users in two months. In May 2023, Nvidia’s (NVDA) market value “briefly topped $1 trillion dollars for the first time, cementing its status as the AI chip leader.” Investor Guide (00:02:40) The Magnificent Seven didn't just dominate the markets this year, they also topped the list of the most trafficked ticker pages on Yahoo Finance.
