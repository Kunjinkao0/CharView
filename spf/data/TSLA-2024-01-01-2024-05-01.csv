How can the auto sector ignite demand and what is ahead for the space in the near and long term? The Futurum Group Research Director Olivier Blanchard joins Market Domination to discuss the shift in focus for automakers to make EVs and hybrids. Blanchard lays out one of the current issues with the EV market, causing slower adoption among consumers: ""Currently the EV market and the automotive market for software-defined vehicles and EVs, simultaneously, is a little skewed on the side of more expensive models, and consumers are just kind of worried about that kind of spending right now. Things are expensive. Obviously, there's inflation. There's a little bit of price gouging and people are a little bit closer to their budgets and so what we're seeing is a reluctance to buy EVs for two reasons. One, most are still a little above the price point that the average consumer for a mainstream adoption of EVs is comfortable with and the other one is fear about charging and infrastructure, about the serviceability of the vehicles, and also about the long-term resale of these vehicles once the batteries and the technologies on board have a few years on them.""

Pelosky offers his views on China's tech sector: ""We're more keen on tech outside the United States, and in particular, in China. And so, we have identified what we call a two-tech stack divide between the US and China, where both countries are basically sealing off their tech sectors from each other, and we think that creates a real opportunity within China tech, which has been a huge laggard versus the US. Its e-commerce market is twice the size of the US, growing at 10% per annum, and the stocks, like Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (0700.HK), etc, are trading at a 50 to 60% discount to the United States tech stocks.""

Deutsche Bank Lead US Autos Analyst Emmanuel Rosner joins Market Domination to explain the downgrade. Rosner says ""there's a strategic change"" occurring within Tesla, saying that the company's new pricing strategies could potentially boost margins and overall profitability. However, he cautions that if Tesla redirects all of its resources toward the development of a robotaxi, it could face prolonged challenges. For long-term investors, the concept of the robotaxi remains ""exciting"", but Rosner expresses concerns about Tesla's new direction. He emphasizes the risks of concentrating the company’s efforts solely on the robotaxi, moving away from its core electric vehicle production. According to Rosner, this strategy ""is extremely risky for investors"", as ""it's betting the entire company on robotaxi"", an unproven market segment that other automotive competitors have faced setbacks in.

Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber joins Market Domination Overtime to discuss the situation with Tesla and Musk and why he is ""grateful"" to have sold the stock in recent months. Gerber gives his full thoughts over the company and the position he has taken: ""We trimmed Tesla down to a reasonable position, about a 2% position in our firm and in my fund. I love the company. I want to make it clear, the products are amazing. It's a great company with great employees and I just think it's being mismanaged at this point. And it -- you know, I think their strategies are not working. So we've lowered our position, I hope I don't end up selling out of this position because I do think the long-term for Tesla could be amazing if it had the focus of a full-time CEO.""

To provide insight into these developments, Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware Charles Elson Founding Director joins Market Domination. Elson expresses skepticism about the potential approval of Musk's compensation plan, noting that even if shareholders were to vote in favor, it may not supersede the previous court decision that struck down the package. He emphasizes that the plan being proposed is not meaningfully different from the one that was deemed ""not effectively fair"" by the courts. On the proposed move, ""The real question is, why would a shareholder vote for a move that the CEO says a court has decided against me because what I did was inequitable? So, I'm going to a jurisdiction where they'll say that's okay,"" Elson told Yahoo Finance. Elson argues that, ultimately, the board's responsibility is to ensure that Tesla survives beyond Musk's tenure. ""At some point you have to say 'enough.' That's that where I think you need board refreshment. Obviously this board is unwilling to do it,"" Elson says.

Doran finds Ford to be performing in line when compared to General Motors' (GM) proportionally larger figures, giving the former more room to grow, especially as it prioritizes new hybrid models while EV charging infrastructure is slowly built out. ""There's a number of catalysts because this has been an ongoing turnaround story, and they have done so many things,"" Doran tells Yahoo Finance. ""One of them... is just rationalizing their product lineup. They're really looking for which vehicles are the most profitable and for them that tends to be their pickup trucks, their SUVs, they've really scaled down on the cars..."" Tesla's biggest challenge, according to Doran, is that it's beginning to lose market share to domestic and Chinese competitors. ""The total pie has expanded, but the pie is not expanding for now. So they're losing share both in China and in the US, and you've seen this through their price cuts."" Catch more of Good Buy or Goodbye here, or watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Here’s how to invest.,"You could be flying above traffic to the airport in an electric air taxi for the same cost as an Uber (UBER) by 2025, at least according to Joby Aviation (JOBY). Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing vehicles (eVTOLs) promise efficient, battery-powered transport akin to urban Ubers or Lyfts (LYFT) in the sky. With backing from major players like Delta (DAL) and Toyota (TM), Joby thinks they can be first to market in the crowded space. However, regulatory approval remains a key hurdle. The Federal Aviation Administration thinks a competitive, scaled air taxi market could launch in at least one location by 2028. Yahoo Finance spoke with industry investors, officials, and analysts, and traveled to Joby’s manufacturing facility in Marina, CA, to get a closer look at what to expect from this emerging sector. For those looking to play the future of aviation, regulatory hurdles, lack of infrastructure, and customer affordability are among the top considerations when sussing out eVTOL investments. If you’re going to future-proof your portfolio, you need to know what’s NEXT. In this series, Yahoo Finance will feature stories that give a glimpse at the future, and show how companies are making big moves today that will matter tomorrow.

Citi is the latest group to lower its price target, setting the figure at $180 per share from $196. The analyst behind the call, Citi Autos & Auto Parts Analyst Itay Michaeli, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the challenges ahead for Tesla.  Michaeli explains that the reduced price target reflects Tesla's first quarter delivery miss and other April data points. He explains that Tesla's challenges are the outcome of its own success over the years, having created a saturated effect on vehicle sales in certain regions, such as the US. ""When you do have these levels of saturation, even price cuts don't do much to stimulate demand,"" Michaeli says. While these challenges are ""solvable,"" the Citi analyst adds that the issues are having a bigger effect than expected on the automaker. On Tesla's robotaxi unveiling, Michaeli notes his appreciation for the company's focus on autonomous vehicles, calling autonomous driving the ""most powerful mobility mega-trend out there."" However, he outlines a scenario in which Tesla does not sufficiently discuss deployment challenges during the robotaxi's unveiling.  For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance.

They want to participate in that, and Nvidia is the leader of the pack. And I think with Apple and Tesla... retail investors tend to look for buying opportunities for names that they've owned in the past.

Currently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is disputing a Reuters report citing Tesla's plans to cancel its low-cost EV strategy as it contends with competition in China.  Roth MKM Senior Research Analyst Craig Irwin joins Market Domination to discuss the contested news with Tesla and why he believes, despite the recent slowdown in demand for EVs, he remains bullish long-term on the EV company. Irwin affirms: ""People know me as a bear on Tesla. I'm bearish on the valuation... but I'm a bull on EVs for the long term. Why? Because EVs are so compelling. 65% fewer components. They should be cheaper than ICE [internal combustion engine] vehicles...

TECHnalysis Research President and Chief Analyst Bob O'Donnell joins Yahoo Finance to break down the recent movements in the tech sector and how its major players can operate moving forward.

If we look at it collectively, I still think there is several years of growth in the collective semiconductor market for AI-powered stuff. So, you're going to see, as I said, I talked about AMD (AMD). Intel (INTC) will be interesting to see.""

126726661,2024-03-28 18:00:03,0.9,"GM will be executing on its EV ambitions in 2024, says CEO Mary Barra",General Motors chair and CEO Mary Barra tells Yahoo Finance this is the year of executing on big goals.
126726560,2024-03-28 17:55:16,0.9,GM's Mary Barra is going all in on EVs,"Contrary to other automakers, who in response to slowing consumer demand are scaling back plans to convert their car and truck lineups to all-electric, General Motors (GM) Chair & CEO Mary Barra is still all in on EVs. ""We will be selling more EVs in this country than anyone else, including Tesla,"" Barra told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in an exclusive interview at GM's technical campus in Michigan.It's a fitting stance for a leader who has overcome a host of issues over her 10 years at the helm of 100-year-old plus GM - by taking a different approach and applying a different vision than others before her. At the time Barra took over as CEO, General Motors was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely changing GM's siloed culture and simultaneously changing how the public viewed the company’s cars, as well as regaining their trust. And now she's looking to take GM into a future that she believes includes cars and trucks that run on batteries. Yahoo Finance got the rare opportunity to sit shotgun with Barra in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette to hear how the change-maker CEO intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles, despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders. Lead This Way is an interview series that features frank conversations with today’s leaders. The series gives consumers and investors an inside look into the innovative thinking and diverse life experiences of some of the biggest players in business to find out how they lead through change, and how they define success for themselves and their organizations.

The last several years now we've been bringing artificial intelligence to that as well, so having a concierge that you could interact with.

Canaccord Genuity LLC Managing Director George Gianarikas joins Yahoo Finance to highlight how Tesla could turn its lagging performance around and remain a worthwhile opportunity for investors. Gianarikas notes that for Tesla's stock to experience a turnaround, several developments must emerge from the automaker's record research and development spending: ""First, the next generation vehicle has to start to ramp, or people have to gain confidence that it's going to ramp and be successful. Second, their margins need to go up. The most likely lever for that happening is the increase of FSD, full self-driving penetration, which leverages the AI they built, in addition to volume starting to pick up.

Tesla's (TSLA) Elon Musk claims, however, that trade restrictions keep US automakers from being ""demolished."" Robinson Meyer, Heatmap Founding Executive Editor, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the landscape of the EV market and the competition between the US market and Chinese automakers. Meyer explains that tariffs will continue to be a stumbling block for regulators and auto suppliers: ""What we're seeing is that auto markets, especially European auto markets, are having a hard time figuring out exactly how to craft trade protections that on the one hand, keep this deluge of very cheap cars from China out of their domestic markets, protecting their local automakers and on the other hand... that keep local automakers, either domestic automakers, whether that's Volkswagen (VOW.DE) or Peugeot (STLA) in Europe, or Ford (F) and GM (GM) in the US, competitive and at the cutting edge of vehicle technology.

126272479,2024-03-02 21:00:43,0.9,Tony Robbins reveals his top secrets for successful investing,"When the hype is reaching new heights, it may be a good time to reach for the tried and true. As the S&P 500 (^GSPC) sets new records and ""Magnificent Seven"" trades such as Nvidia (NVDA) sail past red to white hot, remember to keep an even keel, advised life and business strategist Tony Robbins. ""If a Ferrari was on sale for 70% off, you'd buy it. But when your favorite stock is, people freak out. And when the thing is too expensive, they want to buy it,"" Robbins told Yahoo Finance. ""It's the crazy part of humanity."" Long-term fortunes are not built on a single asset class, let alone a single industry. Diversification is key to wealth generation, said Robbins, who has interviewed the likes of billionaires Ray Dalio, Robert Smith, and Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK-A, BRK-B) Warren Buffett. His latest book, ""The Holy Grail of Investing,"" digs into the power of alternative assets in a world obsessed with stocks. ""There [are] 250,000 companies that are from a $100 million to $3 billion [in value] that private equity can step into,"" said Robbins. ""Instead of trying to evaluate [the Magnificent Seven], create the diversification for yourself. So you reduce your risk by 80%."" His other tip for success includes turning a consumer mindset into an investor mindset: Those iPhone upgrades will cost you thousands, but a pile of Apple (AAPL) stock can set you up for the future. And regardless of where you're sitting in life, staying hungry can turn a losing tide — or extend a winning streak. ""If you're hungry, you'll find the answers. If you're hungry, you'll push through,"" said Robbins."

Westly comments on what Musk and Tesla need to focus on for 2024: ""They need to scramble to find the next growth wave, $25,000 car, at least 18 months out, that may be a game changer, might get them back to 30 or 40% growth. What are you going to do in the next 18 months? And I think they've got three shots on goal. They've got the self-driving vehicle with robotaxis. Probably still three five years out. They've got an energy division which most people don't even think about, and that is doing $6 billion last year on the way to maybe $8 or $9 billion this year, growing 50%. That could be a $20 billion division and then they've got the global charging network, because everybody has basically thrown up the white flag, signed a deal with Tesla to be able to use their global charging network. They've got to make one of these three things to work to get the growth cycle back.""

The EV maker has been met with a variety of challenges ranging from leadership, strikes, and recent recalls, but is the stock at a good value to buy in or are there other potential plays investors should be adding over Tesla? Gabelli Funds Portfolio Manager Brian Sponheimer joins Yahoo Finance Live alongside Senior Autos Reporter Pras Subramanian to discuss where investors should keep an eye out in the auto industry to boost their portfolios.

The stock is going to earn somewhere between $3.00 [or] $3.50 or $4.00 for this coming year.

125908628,2024-02-16 06:58:09,0.6,Coinbase is 'executing brilliantly': Ark Invest's Cathie Wood,"Coinbase (COIN) released its fourth quarter report beating expectations with a revenue of $953.8 million. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) regained its $1 trillion market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2021. With the rise of bitcoin investing with spot bitcoin ETF approval, many on Wall Street are expressing more interest in the digital asset. Ark Invest CEO and CIO Cathie Wood, a vocal advocate of bitcoin, joins Yahoo Finance to give her insight into the crypto markets, Coinbase's performance, Ark Invest's bitcoin ETF, ARK 21 shares bitcoin (ARKB), and more. Wood adds the trading platform is ""executing brilliantly."" On Coinbase, Wood claims that it's the ""most compliant exchange out there"" from a regulatory perspective. She also notes that it's competition is fading, especially given the collapse of FTX and the issues Binance has been facing.  Wood gives her view on the future of bitcoin: ""We do five-year plus forecasts, so we're focused on how institutions and countries and companies might use this new asset class for different reasons. So, we think we have just begun from a price appreciation point of view. This is part of a journey. I do believe the SEC giving the green light has encouraged institutions to think carefully about it and have a point of view, so we're in the learning phase right now, and I think over time that this movement into this new asset class will continue to push up the price."" When it comes to Tesla (), Wood says she would support CEO Elon Musk's bid to incorporate the company in Texas, saying a Delaware judge took ""the vote away from us, the shareholder"" who voted in for Musk's sizable pay package.

125908630,2024-02-16 03:49:13,1,Beyond the Ticker: Nvidia,"From creating chips for gaming to becoming one of the world's leading AI chip companies, it's safe to say Nvidia (NVDA) is officially one of the tech giants. In 2023, the company generated nearly $27 billion in revenue, and its market value is well over $1 trillion. Let's take a closer look at what led to Nvidia's boom with Beyond the Ticker, where we dive into the company's biggest moments. 1993 Nvidia was founded on April 5, 1993, by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem, with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming industry. 1997 Nvidia launched its first hit product, the NV3. It would later go on to sell a whopping 1 million units in its first four months of availability. 1999 On January 22, 1999, Nvidia went public via IPO at $12 per share. 2000 Microsoft (MSFT) chose Nvidia to develop the graphics hardware for the first Xbox console. 2005 Microsoft rival Sony (SONY) chose Nvidia’s hardware to power the PlayStation 3. 2010 Nvidia became the graphics chip supplier for automaker Audi. 2015 The company launched its Nvidia Drive chip for powering driver assistance systems. 2016 Nvidia kicked off its AI efforts with the launch of its DGX-1 server for artificial intelligence applications. 2018 The company debuted the NVIDIA RTX, the first GPU capable of real-time ray tracing. That same year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced it was using Nvidia’s Tesla (TSLA) P4 graphics cards for its Google Cloud Platform. 2022 Nvidia debuted its H100 graphics chip for AI, which still stands as one of the world’s most powerful chips for artificial intelligence apps. 2023 In May 2023, Nvidia eclipsed the $1 trillion market cap mark, joining the ranks of mega companies like Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft. The stock continues to surpass its all-time highs over the past month and is currently trading at over $700 per share. From a company of three engineers working on a graphics card, to thousands of employees working on chips that will power the AI supercomputers of the future, Nvidia remains at the top of the tech industry. From tech giants to retail titans, Beyond the Ticker is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today. Check out more of our Beyond the Ticker series, and be sure to tune in to Yahoo Finance. Editor's note: This video was produced by Zach Faulds."

125864803,2024-02-15 00:04:54,0.9,What To Watch: Nvidia Earnings,"Nvidia (NVDA) is Wall Street’s AI darling. The company’s stock price is on a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we’ll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth quarter earnings on Feb. 21. #1 Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia is the tech industry’s go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative AI models. Heck, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company will purchase an incredible 350,000 Nvidia H100 cards by the end of 2024 at a price tag well into the billions of dollars. Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), you name it, every company is clamoring for Nvidia’s chips. And those are just the tech giants. Smaller firms are also working to get their mitts on Nvidia’s offerings. And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stands to continue to gain considerably. #2 Market Expectations - Expectations for Nvidia’s fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period when revenue rocked an incredible 206% year-over-year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts’ prior expectations of $17.8 billion. And Wall Street doesn’t see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia price target to $800 from $700. Goldman Sachs also raised its target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock. #3 Regulation & Competition: Still, it’s not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with U.S. export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn’t hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales. Then there are its rivals: AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are slowly but surely building out their own high-powered AI chips, with AMD, in particular, gaining on Nvidia’s tail. That company says its latest MI300X chip can go toe-to-toe with Nvidia’s H100, a claim Nvidia refuted via a blog post. Nvidia’s own customers including Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) are also building out their own AI chips, which could cut into the total addressable market for third-party AI chips. Still, those threats are relatively distant at this point. Nvidia is still riding high at the moment. And we’ll find out it can keep the hype train rolling when it reports its results Feb. 21."

He notes rules exist to counter the human ""tendency"" of power corrupting. Mukunda emphasizes that properly governing a CEO means constructively challenging them. Rather than granting any wish, directors must provide guidance - and discipline when warranted.

125499246,2024-02-03 07:20:47,0.1,Not just Tesla: Why so many companies incorporate in Delaware,"Tesla’s (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has called for a shareholder vote to move Tesla’s incorporation to Texas. What would he want to move Tesla to the ""Lone Star State""? Ann Lipton, Tulane Law Associate Professor joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss what this move could look like for the EV giant—and why Delaware has been a popular state for incorporation. Lipton explains that Delaware became a preferred choice in the early 1900s, and that due to its courts and its offering of “a very up-to-date corporate law that responds to the latest trends,” it has maintained that status. Delaware is unique in that it has a specialized court that hears business disputes only—where only chancellors who are experts preside. This system, according to Lipton allows for “reliable decisions,” in a shorter time. Delaware has been able to create a “network effect,” notes Lipton, who states that precedence has been set to the point that generally outcomes are clear and easier to reach. Acknowledging Nevada as a comparable to Delaware in some ways, Lipton sees it as “attractive” to some, but flexibility and freedom is limited for investors. “Nevada has carved out a little niche for itself,” according to Lipton. Speaking on the process to incorporate in Texas, Lipton expects there would be “some hold ups."" Lipton does not see Musk gaining any wiggle-room apart from the greater possibility of “friendly judges” in Texas, and states that “it's definitely a risky move,” for Musk.

Deciphering which stocks on the S&P 500 to pick for further growth can be daunting.

Basenese chooses Eli Lilly (LLY) as his Good Buy, citing the fact that the company is still in its ""early stages of growth,"" possesses ""multifaceted momentum"" behind its GLP-1 weight loss drug, and a best-in-class pipeline to dominate the market versus its competition. Basenese chooses Tesla (TSLA) as his Goodbye, citing the stock being overhyped and overpriced by many metrics on the fundamentals of the business, there is now a more competitive market, which the company did not have to face for years until now, and less investor confidence from business decisions made by leadership like CEO Elon Musk.

Elon Musk recently had a string of controversial statements and moves causing many conversations around leadership of his companies, including Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX. Craig Irwin, ROTH MKM Senior Research Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss this latest report from the Wall Street Journal and how Elon Musk has shaped the industries he has worked in. Irwin comments on the report : ""I think this has been known to people in government for many years. I first had a conversation with someone in a relevant entity about this more than five years ago and I think that there are several other people that could have been highlighted in that article. It smells like a hit piece. 'Why now?' is the bigger question. You know, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me, given that Tesla's really executing. They're doing a phenomenal job at SpaceX. We could talk about real risks that don't have anything to do with Elon's recreational chemistry.""

Buttigieg talks looming shutdown,"With a new year comes new hurdles for Congress, including avoiding another potential government shutdown. While US aviation agencies have made much progress, and US airlines were able to handle the 2023 holiday rush, that could all come to a halt if Congress cannot come to a consensus, or if new regime takes over in 2025 and makes major changes to federal policy. US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg sits down with Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi to discuss the potential for a government shutdown and the impact it will have for transportation across the US. Buttigieg explains how a shutdown could thwart efforts to expand the number of people working as air traffic controllers, saying it would ""stop us in our tracks."" The Secretary says that preparing for the last shutdown threat ""cost a lot of time, and effort, and energy, and money just getting ready for the possibility of that."" The 2024 race for the White House is starting to heat up. If former President Trump were to win, there is a possibility he could gut some tax credits for EVs. Buttigieg says of that possibility: ""A radical policy shift like that would dramatically undermine the American auto industry, at the very moment when there have been so many gains in a made-in-America EV revolution, under the Biden-Harris administration. The reality is former President Trump allowed China to build a major advantage in EV batteries and EV manufacturing at the very moment when it began to become obvious that EVs are going to be the future and that we can't keep people trapped in gas cars any more than you can keep phone users trapped on land lines for the next hundred years.""
